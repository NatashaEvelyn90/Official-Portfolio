I am someone who loves anything dealing with the arts; such as Theatre, Drawing and Music. From a young age, I was just excited to be a part of it; whether it was the melodic strains of a symphony, the brushstrokes of a manga artist, or the electrifying performances on stage, these forms of expression ignited a passion within me that has only deepened over time.</p>
    
                    <p class="text-center">Each art form tells a unique story, and I find immense joy in exploring music, drawing, and theatre. With a sketchpad in hand and a playlist that seems to be more K-pop than usual, I immerse myself in creative endeavors, crafting worlds and experiences that reflect my innermost thoughts and dreams.</p> 
    
                    <p class="text-center">As I continue to navigate this artistic journey, I have seemed to have stumbled onto a new adventure: learning the skills to become a front-end developer. This pursuit is not just about coding; it's about weaving together creativity and technology. I am fascinated by the way a well-designed website can evoke emotion, tell a story, and create a connection between people. Being able to marry my love for the arts with the precision of development allows me to channel my creativity into building engaging and interactive digital experiences. Each line of code I write feels like a brushstroke on a canvas, bringing my visions to life...with sometimes the added stress!</p>
                
                    <p class="text-center mb-5">With a brush in one hand and a coding keyboard in the other, this multi-talented individual is on the verge of crafting a reality where creativity and technology intertwine seamlessly. <span>My journey is just beginning,</span> and every step is like a new verse in a song, written about my life—a melody that sings of passion, innovation, and endless possibilities. <span>SHOUTOUT TO MY WORLD,</span> where imagination knows no limits and every day is an opportunity to create something stunning...or funny if I feel like it.</p>
